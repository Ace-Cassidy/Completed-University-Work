Keyevent -> VIC2 -> IRQ31 -> VIC1
State: Scancode in kbd data register and an interrupt fires
Interrupt -> Jump to IRQ vector -> Jump to interrupt handler
State: CPU is in IRQ mode using IRQ stack and executing handler
Handler -> determine interrupt source/type -> call appropriate handler
State: CPU is executing kbd handler
KBDHandler -> read kbd data and clear interrupt -> return char and exit IRQ mode
