PROBLEM 1
Consider global alignment with affine gap penalty function.  Let the scoring 
scheme parameters be as follows:  

match score (ma) = +1; mismatch penalty (mi) = -2; gap opening penalty (h) = -5; 
gap extension penalty (g) = -1.

PROBLEM 2 
For s1 and s2, let OPTS1(s1, s2) denote an optimal global alignment path
reported using the scoring scheme 

(S1):ma=x,mi=y and g=z, for some arbitrary integers x >0, y <0 and z <0. 

Now consider the following two modified scoring schemes:

(S2):ma=x∗d,mi=y∗d, and g=z∗d, where d >0;
(S3):ma=x+d,mi=y+d, andg=z+d, whered >0;

For s1 and s2, how would the optimal alignment paths computed under scoring 
schemes S2 and S3 individually compare with OPTS1(s1, s2)? Are they guaranteed 
to be the same as OPTS1(s1, s2) or could they differ from OPTS1(s1, s2)? 
Justify your answers. For simplicity, assume that the two strings are such that 
there exists only one unique optimal path under each of three scoring schemes.
PS: Note that the emphasis on this question is on the optimal path and not the 
score itself, as the latter will obviously change with any change in the scoring
scheme.

RESPONSE
Observe that an arbitrary global alignment obeys the following:

alignment score = optimal( a*ma + b*mi + c*g )
alignment length = a + b + c

where optimal() finds the optimal a, b, and c which obey the alignment length
and alignment rules (global alignment)

In order for an alignment to be invariant from one scoring scheme to another the
quantities a, b, and c must remain unchanged (the number of gaps, matches, and 
mismatches cannot change) while still giving the maximal score. 

For S2 observe:

alignment score = optimal(  a*(x*d) + b*(y*d) + c*(z*d))
                = optimal(( a*x + b*y + c*z) * d )
                = optimal(  a*x + b*y + c*z) ) * d

The variable d is not involved in computing the values for a, b, and c but only
acts a scale factor for the alignment score, and so S2 reduces to S1

For S3 observe:

alignment score = optimal(  a*(x+d) + b*(y+d) + c*(z+d))
                = optimal(( a*x + a*d + b*y + b*d + c*z + c*d))
                = optimal(( a*x + a*d + b*y + b*d + c*z + c*d))

There is no way to equate this to scheme S1 or S2, and so we assume that the
there exists some sequence for which a,b, c are different under S3 than under
S1 or S2
